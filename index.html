                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                  California's Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) bill allows a local government to form a load serving entity to compete for retail customers and electricity supply with the investor-owned electric utility (IOU) that operates within its jurisdiction. In theory, CCAs could reduce the costs and/or enhance the speed of decarbonization of electricity supply. In reality, a flawed market design, the transfer of regulatory burdens from the IOUs to the CCAs, and the wide variability in community capacities and motivations imperil achieving either goal. IOU ownership and state regulation of distribution and transmission effectively eliminate meaningful price competition. Transferring financial responsibility past electricity procurement and system reliability from IOUs to CCAs creates a ceiling on the greenness and a floor on the price of CCA power. Devolution of electricity procurement to local communities that differ in intensities of preferences for green energy, local investment in generation, and lower end-user prices results in variation in energy portfolios and financial stability among CCAs. We call this energy sorting, i.e. a self-selected grouping of energy consumers by income and commitment to decarbonization. This process has implications for decarbonization because CCAs often bear the responsibility for designing and implementing residential, transportation and commercial electrification programs. Some of these problems, such as finding the right scale for CCAs through creation of joint power agreements, are being solved. Others, such as problematic regulation of the relationship between IOUs and CCAs, will require more extensive reforms.

           <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>Customers serviced by California's investor-owned utilities (IOU) face the highest electricity rates in the continental United States. Since 2019, IOU prices, on average, have increased by 43% when adjusted for inflation. High electricity prices pose significant affordability challenges and may hamper the state's goal for large-scale electrification and decarbonization. However, not everyone in the state faces high prices: more than 70 power providers in California lead to considerable variation in customers’ electricity rates. While customers in IOU and Community Choice Aggregators (CCA) face steeply rising rates, publicly-owned utility (POU) customers do not. This work describes the structural sources of rate heterogeneity between power providers and contextualizes utility costs, earnings, and returns. We identify major drivers of rate increase in the IOUs and CCAs using historical regulatory, financial, and rate data. Recent IOU price hikes are due to network infrastructure investments in response to wildfires, and CCA reach price parity due to exit charges levied on them. We also find that IOUs’ operations and maintenance expenses on distribution and transmission networks largely remained constant despite an aging infrastructure until wildfire events occurred. Like most electricity utilities in the United States, California IOUs earn a guaranteed return on equity higher than investment-grade bond yield. On the other hand, POUs consistently have cheaper electricity, but most of them service urban and suburban areas with low wildfire risks. We foresee continued price divergence owing to wildfire mitigation costs, which will have varying affordability consequences across the state. </p>

                 <details><summary>Introduction</summary><p>The Biden administration has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. To meet these targets the United States will have to quickly build a vast amount of clean energy infrastructure, replacing fossil fuel powered electricity generation with renewable sources of electricity like wind and solar. In addition, direct consumption of fossil fuels such as gasoline-powered cars and gas-powered heating will have to be electrified and powered by the new clean electric grid. These factors combined mean that to achieve the Biden administration’s targets, the electric grid needs to be expanded by at least 60% by 2030, and electricity demand may nearly double by 2050.
                  Such a rapid expansion of the renewable electricity system would require the quick planning, permitting, and building of renewable energy sources like solar plants and wind farms. It also requires long-distance electric transmission lines to transport clean energy from sparsely populated areas where it is abundant to the urban centers where it is sorely needed.
                  There are many obstacles to the rapid deployment of this infrastructure, but one key obstacle at the center of much debate is the federal permit process. As part of recent negotiations to secure the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Senator Joe Manchin made a “side deal” with Democratic leaders. In this deal, he made his critical support for the IRA contingent on the passage of an energy infrastructure permit reform bill, which, among other provisions, aims to speed the processes of federal permitting by setting time limits on environmental reviews, prioritizing certain big-ticket projects, and limiting state powers in permitting related to electric transmission and clean water protection (although Sen. Manchin pulled this bill from immediate must-pass legislation, his proposed reforms may return to the Senate floor at a later time).
                  Permitting reform such as Senator Manchin's would need to clear a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, requiring bipartisan support. Indeed, Republicans and Democrats generally agree that the federal permitting process requires reform, and various efforts were made under Presidents Obama, Trump, and now Biden. Most wind energy projects in the pipeline are stuck in the permitting phase, with just 21% of planned projects currently under construction. Major transmission projects have run into hurdles or been shelved entirely in recent years. In sum, there is a clear and evident need to proceed with ambitious reform of the nation’s energy infrastructure permit system. However, how exactly to proceed is contentious, with varying views from Republicans and Sen. Manchin, to environmentalists and House progressives.
                  In this article, we examine the current policy landscape of the permitting process, with a focus on renewable energy infrastructure deployment. We evaluate some common obstacles to the permitting of such infrastructure and summarize recent policy action to reform these processes at the federal level.

                 <details><summary>Executive Summary</summary><p>In this article, we provide an analysis of the specific points of delay within the federal permitting process for clean energy infrastructure. We then discuss six major areas of potential reform, including evaluations of existing reform provisions on the table, such as Senator Manchin's proposed legislation. In each area, we provide policy options that would make a significant impact on shortening permitting timelines, avoid affecting the integrity of environmental review, and attract support across the political spectrum. We conclude with options for permitting reform at the local and state levels, both of which have important planning and compliance roles in clean energy infrastructure development, making them critical pieces of the puzzle. Below are the highlights of the policy options we present:

                  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the goal of being the first civilian university to reach space, The Stanford Student Space Initiative's Spaceshot Team (SSI Spaceshot) has designed a custom rocket-balloon (rockoon) system to achieve an apogee height of greater than 100 km (i.e. to cross the Kármán Line, a widely-accepted definition of the boundary of space), while demonstrating a cheap, low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), suborbital launch technology. Suborbital launch represents a high-potential space for growth in aerospace as it provides a high-value market for aerospace research and a low-cost, lower-risk opportunity for agents with less capital to access space. Technologies such as this open-source rocket-balloon system provide an incredible opportunity to democratize space and provide access to aerospace to all. Leveraging the experience of an international-award-winning rockets team, a world-record-breaking high-altitude balloon team, and members who have built satellites, high-voltage DNA synthesizers, and more, SSI is building an integrated rocket-balloon system. The system consists of a zero-pressure balloon platform which will carry a 20 kg rocket with a commercial-off-the-shelf motor to 27 km. At that height, the rocket will launch to reach a final expected apogee of 125 km. Although the underlying architecture has been verified and tested for decades, from NASA to modern space startups, SSI's design is heavily optimized to be low SWaP, affordable, and accessible as an open-source platform. In the process of creating an efficient, effective design in this problem space, SSI has created custom composites designed for the hypersonic thermal load, designed robust payload bays to survive high-shock, and investigated different stability methods for high-altitude, low-atmospheric-density launches. This project hopes to advance the emerging field of accessible aerospace by publishing our simple and achievable design for suborbital launch technology.</details>
