         <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
              <p>Customers serviced by California's investor-owned utilities (IOU) face the highest electricity rates in the continental United States. Since 2019, IOU prices, on average, have increased by 43% when adjusted for inflation. High electricity prices pose significant affordability challenges and may hamper the state's goal for large-scale electrification and decarbonization. However, not everyone in the state faces high prices: more than 70 power providers in California lead to considerable variation in customers’ electricity rates. While customers in IOU and Community Choice Aggregators (CCA) face steeply rising rates, publicly-owned utility (POU) customers do not. This work describes the structural sources of rate heterogeneity between power providers and contextualizes utility costs, earnings, and returns. We identify major drivers of rate increase in the IOUs and CCAs using historical regulatory, financial, and rate data. Recent IOU price hikes are due to network infrastructure investments in response to wildfires, and CCA reach price parity due to exit charges levied on them. We also find that IOUs’ operations and maintenance expenses on distribution and transmission networks largely remained constant despite an aging infrastructure until wildfire events occurred. Like most electricity utilities in the United States, California IOUs earn a guaranteed return on equity higher than investment-grade bond yield. On the other hand, POUs consistently have cheaper electricity, but most of them service urban and suburban areas with low wildfire risks. We foresee continued price divergence owing to wildfire mitigation costs, which will have varying affordability consequences across the state. </p>

                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                  California's Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) bill allows a local government to form a load serving entity to compete for retail customers and electricity supply with the investor-owned electric utility (IOU) that operates within its jurisdiction. In theory, CCAs could reduce the costs and/or enhance the speed of decarbonization of electricity supply. In reality, a flawed market design, the transfer of regulatory burdens from the IOUs to the CCAs, and the wide variability in community capacities and motivations imperil achieving either goal. IOU ownership and state regulation of distribution and transmission effectively eliminate meaningful price competition. Transferring financial responsibility past electricity procurement and system reliability from IOUs to CCAs creates a ceiling on the greenness and a floor on the price of CCA power. Devolution of electricity procurement to local communities that differ in intensities of preferences for green energy, local investment in generation, and lower end-user prices results in variation in energy portfolios and financial stability among CCAs. We call this energy sorting, i.e. a self-selected grouping of energy consumers by income and commitment to decarbonization. This process has implications for decarbonization because CCAs often bear the responsibility for designing and implementing residential, transportation and commercial electrification programs. Some of these problems, such as finding the right scale for CCAs through creation of joint power agreements, are being solved. Others, such as problematic regulation of the relationship between IOUs and CCAs, will require more extensive reforms.

                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                  India's free school lunch program has been widely acknowledged as a success in terms of raising primary school enrollment. However, heterogeneity within its effects has not been examined in the literature. In particular, I hypothesize that the nature of food as a site of systematic caste-based discrimination causes differential (lower) enrollment effects for marginalized castes. I use administrative data from the initial years of the universal program in the poor northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to show plausibly causal estimates of caste-based heterogeneity in effects. I find that are statistically significant 12-14 percentage point gaps in enrollment between Scheduled Caste and other students.

                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                  The climate impacts of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States are unclear, yet have been the subject of intense recent debate. I review and synthesise existing evidence from a lifecycle assessments of LNG export, finding that sensitivity to methane leakage is the key determinant of net emissions impact. I conduct a meta-analysis of the scientific literature on upstream methane leakage from U.S. gas production, finding that prevailing leakage rates suggest net emissions increases from LNG export. Additionally, I extract detailed scenarios from international energy pathway modeling to argue that LNG exports are incompatible with a global commitment to keep warming under 1.5 degrees.

                 <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Biden administration aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, necessitating a substantial expansion of clean energy infrastructure. This transition involves replacing fossil fuel electricity generation with renewable sources like wind and solar and electrifying direct fossil fuel consumption, resulting in a projected 60% increase in the electric grid by 2030 and a potential doubling of electricity demand by 2050. However, rapid deployment faces significant challenges, particularly in the federal permitting process. A notable element of recent legislative negotiations was Senator Joe Manchin's side deal, linking his support for the Inflation Reduction Act to the passage of an energy infrastructure permit reform bill aimed at streamlining federal permitting, imposing time limits on environmental reviews, prioritizing key projects, and limiting state authority. While bipartisan agreement exists on the need for permitting reform, the specifics remain contentious, with varying perspectives from stakeholders including Republicans, environmentalists, and progressives. This article analyzes the current policy landscape regarding the permitting process for renewable energy infrastructure, identifies key obstacles, and reviews recent federal policy efforts aimed at reforming these processes.

We then discuss six major areas of potential reform, including evaluations of existing reform provisions on the table, such as Senator Manchin's proposed legislation. In each area, we provide policy options that would make a significant impact on shortening permitting timelines, avoid affecting the integrity of environmental review, and attract support across the political spectrum. We conclude with options for permitting reform at the local and state levels, both of which have important planning and compliance roles in clean energy infrastructure development, making them critical pieces of the puzzle.

                 <details><summary>Executive Summary</summary><p>The effects of seasonal paddy stubble burning are severe—it causes an estimated loss of 150,000 years of healthy life annually. Underlying stubble burning, however, is a paddy-wheat cropping system with wide-ranging effects on the region. The dominant practice of growing paddy in the kharif (monsoon) season and wheat in the rabi (winter) season, doesn't only cause stubble burning. It has also caused Northwest India's farm incomes to stagnate and indebtedness to increase, polluted its environment, drained its groundwater, degraded its soil, and made it vulnerable to climate change. Thus far, solutions supported by philanthropy have treated stubble burning as an isolated issue, focusing primarily on mechanised stubble management interventions. Instead, donors and implementing nonprofits should address it as a part of Northwest India's agricultural system, which is in need of repair.

                 <li> Legalizing Corruption: Electoral Bonds and Political Financing in India</a> (<b>Rayan Sud</b>, MV Rajeev Gowda) </li>
                 <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                      <p>In 2017, a novel political financing instrument, the “electoral bonds” scheme, was introduced in India over serious institutional, political, and legal opposition. Until the Supreme Court declared the scheme to be unconstitutional in 2024, it enabled over Rs. 16,000 crores in unlimited and anonymous corporate money to flow to Indian political parties. Information on fund flows was asymmetric, which in the context of a discretionary state role in the economy, led to a serious pro-incumbent structural bias. Furthermore, in the context of modern electioneering, where legal channels of funding are critical for media and social-media campaigns, disproportionate access to electoral bond funding for the incumbent had outsize effects on its ability to fight and win elections, compounding the scale of the incumbency bias. We document the downstream consequences of the electoral bond scheme, including violations of public trust and citizens' right to information, a shift in power from candidates to central party leaderships, and most importantly, the appearance of large-scale legalised corruption. We outline potential modes of corruption enabled by electoral bonds, provide schematic cases of apparent corruption, and present summary statistics about bond donors and recipients. We conclude by placing India's political financing regime in a broader global context and reiterate the need for comprehensive reform. </p>

The authors of the paper model the economic impact of free secondary education, finding negligible GDP growth (~0.1%) and higher costs compared to benefits, suggesting that investing in educational quality would yield better economic returns. I critique the paper's applicability in the Indian context, emphasizing the need for universal access to secondary education and the importance of education quality. I argue for a balanced approach that considers both economic efficiency and the moral imperative of providing education as a fundamental right, particularly for marginalized communities.

                   <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this article, I review the findings of the paper "Growing Like India," which conducts development accounting to analyze India's rapid growth from 1987 to 2011, focusing particularly on productivity in the consumer services sector. Unlike other nations that have prospered through industrialization, India's growth has been driven largely by services, specifically non-tradable sectors like retail, hospitality, and healthcare. The authors highlight that nearly one-third of India's economic development during this period is attributable to improvements in consumer services productivity, although this growth has been highly unequal, benefiting mainly urban and affluent households. I critique the paper's implications for policymakers, suggesting that while service-led growth has its merits, we should not overlook the long-term benefits of industrialization and the challenges posed by socio-economic inequality. I also address the paper's methodological soundness, questioning the static distinctions made between tradable and non-tradable services in light of technological advancements. Ultimately, I argue for a balanced approach that promotes urbanization and consumer service productivity while also investing in agricultural productivity and addressing inequalities within the growth narrative to create a more inclusive economic future for India.

The study finds that since 1995, greater revenue-side decentralization has shifted spending from welfare to capital investments across 224 local governments. While the findings suggest potential benefits of capital expenditure, I critique the implications for developing countries like India, where local governments often lack accountability and can exacerbate inequality. I argue for a cautious approach to fiscal decentralization in India, emphasizing the need to prioritize human capital investment and strengthen local political institutions before fully decentralizing fiscal powers.
